# RootInteractive


For ALICE CERN see detailed description in issue tracker in JIRA:
* Jupyter notebooks for interactive n-dimensional analysis. Ipywidgets + bokeh. RootInteractive
https://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/PWGPP-485
...

# RootInteractive content:


## Visualization part wrappers
* client/server application (Jupyter+Bokeh+???)
* client application - (Bokeh standalone)

##Machine learning part (plans)
We would like to provide set of wrappers which will simplify/and user analysis using tabular data (trees,csv, pandas ...)
error estimates, robust statistic, handling of extrapolation errors
set of predefined (parametrizable layouts - e.g autonecoders)
Similar approach was choosen recently by GOOGLE (announcement -09.04.2019) and Microsoft (announcement 02.05.2019)

## Integrate the ML part with visualization tools
Similar approach as was choosen by Ilastic project
